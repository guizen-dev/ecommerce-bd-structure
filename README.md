Welcome to the E-Commerce Database Project! This repository showcases a fictional database designed as part of a database programming course. Our primary goal was to create a well-structured and normalized database that adheres to the Third Normal Form (3NF) standards.

## Database Overview

- **Project Purpose:** This database simulates the data management needs of a modern e-commerce platform. It includes tables for products, customers, orders, payments, and more.

- **Normalization:** The entire database has been meticulously designed to adhere to the principles of the Third Normal Form (3NF). This ensures data integrity, minimizes redundancy, and optimizes data storage.

## Key Features

- **Structured Data:** We have organized data into logical tables to facilitate efficient data retrieval and management.

- **Normalization:** Data is organized to eliminate data duplication and update anomalies, reducing the risk of data inconsistencies.

- **Relational Schema:** The database employs a relational schema, allowing for complex queries and data analysis.

- **Sample Data:** The repository includes sample data to demonstrate the database's functionality.

## Database Structure

The database consists of several interconnected tables, including but not limited to:

- Customers
- Products
- Orders
- Order Items
- Payments

The schema has been thoughtfully designed to reflect real-world e-commerce scenarios, enabling a wide range of data management tasks.

## Getting Started

To explore the database or use it as a learning resource, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a relational database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and import the provided SQL files.
3. Query and interact with the database as needed.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this is a fictional database created for educational purposes. It does not represent a real e-commerce platform, and the data used is entirely fabricated.

## Contributing

If you have suggestions for improving the database or find any issues, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
